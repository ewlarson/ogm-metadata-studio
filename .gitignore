# metadata/ is tracked, but we might want to ignore local-only files if any
# resources.csv and distributions.csv seem to be tracked as part of the data model, 
# but if they are generated artifacts, they should be ignored. 
# Based on README, they are views of the metadata, so typically generated?
# However, "Use resources.csv ... for spreadsheet-style editing" suggests they might be source? 
# For now, let's keep them tracked if they are source, or ignore if purely output.
# Given "sync flow stages metadata/, resources.csv...", they are tracked.
